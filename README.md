libratbag
=========

libratbag is a configuration library for gaming mice. It provides a generic
way to access the various features exposed by these mice and abstracts away
hardware-specific and kernel-specific quirks.

libratbag exports the devices over a DBus daemon called ratbagd. ratbagd
needs permissions to access device nodes (primarily /dev/hidraw nodes) and
usually needs to run as root.

Running ratbagd
---------------

ratbagd is intended to run as dbus-activated systemd service. This requires
installation of the following files:

    sudo cp dbus/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.conf /etc/dbus-1/system.d/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.conf
    sudo cp builddir/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.service /etc/dbus-1/system-services/org.freedesktop.ratbag1.conf
    sudo cp builddir/ratbagd.service /etc/systemd/system/ratbagd.service

The files are installed into the prefix by `ninja install`, see also the
configure-time options `-Dsystemd-unit-dir` and `-Ddbus-root-dir` (see
"Compiling ratbagd" below). Developers are encouraged to simply symlink to the
files in the git repository. If you used any other build directory than
`builddir`, adjust accordingly.

For the files to take effect, you should run

    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl reload dbus.service

And finally, to enable the service:

    sudo systemctl enable ratbagd.service

This places the required symlink into the systemd directory so that dbus
activation is possible.

Compiling ratbagd
-----------------

ratbagd uses the meson build system (see http://mesonbuild.com) which in
turn uses ninja to invoke the compiler (`ninja` may be `ninja-build` on your
distribution). From a fresh git checkout, run the following commands to init
the repository:

    meson builddir --prefix=/usr/

And to build or re-build after code-changes, run:

    ninja -C builddir
    sudo ninja -C builddir install

Note: `builddir` is the build output directory and can be changed to any
other directory name. To set configure-time options, use e.g.

    mesonconf builddir -Denable-documentation=false

Run `mesonconf builddir` to list the options.

For easier debugging, objects paths are constructed from the device. e.g.
`/org/freedesktop/ratbag/button/event5/p0/b10` is the button interface for
button 10 on profile 0 on event5. The naming is subject to change. Do not
rely on a constructed object path in your application.

Architecture
------------

libratbag has two main components, libratbag and ratbagd.
The former is a library to access the devices. It consists of
the front-end API and wrapper code, and the back-end HW-specific drivers:

    +-----+    +-----+    +-----------+    +----------+
    | app | -> | API | -> | hw-driver | -> | protocol | -> device
    +-----+    +-----+    +-----------+    +----------+

The API layer is HW agnostic. Depend on the HW, the protocol may be part of
the driver implementation (e.g. etekcity) or a separate set of files
(HID++). Where the protocol is separate, the whole known protocol should be
implemented. The HW driver then only accesses the bits required for
libratbag. This allows us to optionally export the protocol as separate
library in the future, if other projects require it.

Adding Devices
--------------

As of commit 3605bede4 libratbag now uses a hwdb entry to match the device
with the drivers. To access a device through libratbag, the udev property
RATBAG_DRIVER must be set for a device's event node. Check with

     sudo udevadm info /sys/class/input/eventX | grep RATBAG_DRIVER

If your device is not yet assigned the property, it is not in the hwdb. It
may however be supported by one of our existing drivers. Try enabling it by
adding the device vendor-id/product-id to the hwdb file in
`hwdb/70-libratbag-mouse.hwdb`. For example, for a HID++ 1.0 device, edit
the 70-libratbag-mouse.hwdb file and add an entry with `RATBAG_DRIVER=hidpp10`.
For the other drivers, look for the id of the driver in driver-{drivername}.c
file and do the same.

Once your device is added to the hwdb, install libratbag and trigger a hwdb
update:

    sudo udevadm hwdb --update
    sudo udevadm control --reload

Then unplug/replug your mouse. `RATBAG_DRIVER` should appear in the udev
properties of your device with the value you previously set. If the property
is not assigned, the hwdb entry does not correctly match your device or the
installed udev rules/hwdb entries are not picked up by udev.

If the device doesn't work, you'll have to start reverse-engineering the
device-specific protocol. Good luck :)

Building
--------

libratbag uses the meson build system, see http://mesonbuild.com which in
turn uses ninja to invoke the compiler (`ninja` may be `ninja-build` on your
distribution). From a fresh git checkout, run the
following commands to init the repository:

    meson builddir --prefix=/usr/

And to build or re-build after code-changes, run:

    ninja -C builddir
    sudo ninja -C builddir install

Note: 'builddir' is the build output directory and can be changed to any
other directory name. To set configure-time options, use e.g.

    mesonconf builddir -Denable-documentation=false

Run 'mesonconf builddir' to list the options.
