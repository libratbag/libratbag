libratbag data files
====================

This directory contains the SVG files for each theme. In general, device SVGs
should approximate the device to make it immediately recognizable. Detail work
not required, the graphic is an illustration only.

For theme-specific requirements, consult the README in the subdirectories.

Technique
---------

The simplest approach is to find a photo of the device and import it into
inkscape. Put it on the lowest layer, create a new layer "Device" above it
and start tracing the outlines and edges of the device. Fill in the shapes
and your device should resemble the underlying photo. Delete the photo
layer, add leaders and button labels and you're done.
