libratbag default theme
====================

Requirements
------------

- Canvas size: 750x750 pixels
- Two layers in the final SVG: a lower layer named "Device" with the device
  itself, "Leaders" with the buttons and leader-lines
- The device should be approximately centered on the canvas and occupy a
  meaningful portion of the canvas without making it look cramped
- Button labels must be in 12pt Sans, starting with Button0
- Wheel buttons may be labeled separately if required (look at the Etekcity
  for an example)
