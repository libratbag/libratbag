/**
 * @defgroup base Initialization and manipulation of ratbag contexts
 * @defgroup device Querying and manipulating devices
 *
 * Device configuration is managed by "profiles" (see @ref profile).
 * In the simplest case, a device has a single profile that can be fetched,
 * queried and manipulated and then re-applied to the device. Other devices
 * may have multiple profiles, each of which can be queried and managed
 * independently.
 *
 * @defgroup profile Device profiles
 *
 * A profile on a device consists of a set of button functions and, where
 * applicable, a range of resolution settings, one of which is currently
 * active.
 *
 * @defgroup button Button configuration
 *
 * @defgroup resolution Resolution and frequency mappings
 *
 * A device's sensor resolution and report rate can be configured per
 * profile, with each profile reporting a number of resolution modes (see
 * @ref ratbag_resolution). The number depends on the hardware, but at least
 * one is provided by libratbag.
 *
 * Each resolution mode is a tuple of a resolution and report rate and
 * represents the modes that the mouse can switch through, usually with the
 * use of a button on the mouse to cycle through the preconfigured
 * resolutions.
 *
 * The resolutions have a default resolution and a currently active
 * resolution. The currently active one is the one used by the device now
 * and only applies if the profile is currently active too. The default
 * resolution is the one the device will chose when the profile is selected
 * next.
